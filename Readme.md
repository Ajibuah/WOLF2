# 2.Word Guessing Game
This is a simple word guessing game that randomly selects a word from a list of words and allows the user to guess it one letter at a time. The game keeps track of the user's guesses and updates the hidden word accordingly. If the user guesses the correct word, the game ends and the user is congratulated.

Usage
To play the game, simply run the word_guessing_game.py file. The game will randomly select a word from the list of words and display it as a hidden word with only the first and last letters visible. The user will then be prompted to enter a letter or the full word guess. If the user enters a correct letter, the hidden word will be updated to show the correct letter in its place. If the user enters an incorrect letter, the game will continue and the user will be prompted to enter another guess. If the user enters the correct word, the game will end and the user will be congratulated.
